# Internship_ICNS
I had no background in programming. During my internship I programmed the following games:
- The Guess Game: 
In this game the computer generates a random integer number between 0 and max_value (here 1000) and the user has to
guess this number in num_guesses (here 10) turns with the help of the feedbacks he/she gets from the computer.
                  
- Mastermind: 
In this game the computer generates 4 random digits between 1 and 6 and the user has to guess the values and their
order. Computer in response returns some feedback as follows:
 B if the digit and its position are correct,
 W if the digit is correct, but its position is wrong,
 G if the digit is wrong.
              
- Mastermind with Timer: 
different from the simple version (found in Mastermind.py) here the user can decide whether he/she wants to play
with or without the timer with a pre-set time limit.
